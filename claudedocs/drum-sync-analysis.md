# Drum Synchronization Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-29 **Branch**: feature/drum-sync-analysis

## Executive Summary

The drum synchronization system is **well-architected and properly implemented**
with professional-grade timing features. The system uses lookahead scheduling,
proper Tone.js Transport integration, and includes advanced features like swing
timing and micro-timing variations.

**Key Finding**: The synchronization feels solid because it is solid. No
critical issues found.

## Architecture Overview

###

Timing System Components

1. **TimingEngine** (`src/audio/TimingEngine.ts`)
   - Centralized timing control with 100ms lookahead
   - 25ms scheduler interval
   - Proper Transport synchronization
   - Step advancement with 16th note resolution

2. **SequencerContext** (`src/context/SequencerContext.tsx`)
   - Enhanced scheduler with swing and micro-timing
   - Individual drum scheduling via triggerAttackRelease
   - Lookahead-based event scheduling
   - Transport time calculation for precise scheduling

3. **DrumSynthesizer** (`src/audio/DrumSynthesis.ts`)
   - 808/909 drum kits with proper synthesis
   - Consistent triggerAttackRelease interface
   - Duration and time parameters properly handled

## Timing Flow Analysis

### Step Scheduling Process

```
1. Scheduler Loop (every 25ms)
   â†“
2. Check lookahead window (100ms)
   â†“
3. For each step in window:
   - Calculate swing offset (if enabled)
   - Schedule step at precise time
   - Track scheduled events
   â†“
4. scheduleStep() execution:
   - UI update (10ms early for visual sync)
   - Calculate transport time offset
   - Trigger drum synths with precise timing
   â†“
5. Drum triggering:
   - All drums use same '16n' duration
   - Transport time: `+${transportTime}` format
   - Proper Tone.Time handling
```

### Synchronization Strengths

âœ… **Lookahead Scheduling**: 100ms window prevents audio dropouts âœ… **Transport
Integration**: All timing based on Tone.Transport.seconds âœ… **Consistent
Duration**: All drums use '16n' (16th note) duration âœ… **Precise Timing**:
Transport time offsets calculated correctly âœ… **Event Tracking**: Prevents
duplicate scheduling âœ… **Visual Sync**: UI updates 10ms early for
responsiveness

### Advanced Features

1. **Swing Timing** (SequencerContext:244-249)
   - Off-beat delay up to 33% of step length
   - Configurable swing amount (0-100%)
   - Only affects odd-numbered steps

2. **Micro-Timing** (SequencerContext:266-268)
   - Â±0.05% random variation per step
   - Adds human feel to sequencing
   - Optional via `microTimingEnabled` flag

3. **Timing Analysis** (SequencerContext:260-285)
   - Average latency tracking
   - Jitter measurement
   - Missed events counter
   - Performance monitoring

## Drum Synthesis Architecture

### DrumSynthesizer Interface

All drum types implement consistent interface:

```typescript
interface DrumSynth {
  triggerAttackRelease: (duration: ToneDuration, time?: ToneTime) => void
  dispose: () => void
}
```

### Kit Implementations

**808 Kit**:

- Kick: Sine wave with pitch envelope, distortion, compression
- Snare: Noise + tone (200Hz triangle), bandpass filtering
- Hi-hat: Triple square wave oscillators (8/10/12kHz)

**909 Kit**:

- Kick: Click (1600Hz) + body (60Hz) with separate envelopes
- Snare: Noise burst + fundamental (250Hz triangle)
- Hi-hat: MetalSynth with high resonance (4kHz)

### Scheduling Integration

```typescript
// From SequencerContext.tsx:324-327
synth.triggerAttackRelease('16n', `+${transportTime}` as ToneTime)
```

- Duration: Fixed '16n' for all drums
- Time: Relative to Transport with `+${offset}` format
- No velocity parameter (could be enhancement)

## Potential Improvements (Not Issues)

### 1. Velocity Support for Drums

**Current**: All drums triggered at fixed velocity **Opportunity**: Add velocity
parameter to drum patterns

```typescript
// Enhancement suggestion
pattern: [
  [1, 0, 0.8, 0, 1, 0, 0.7, 0, ...], // velocity values 0-1
]

// Triggering
synth.triggerAttackRelease('16n', `+${transportTime}`, velocity)
```

**Impact**: Adds dynamic expression to drum patterns

### 2. Pattern Loop Boundary Handling

**Current**: Pattern loops every 16 steps (SequencerContext:271)
**Observation**: No obvious timing discontinuity at loop boundary

**Validation Needed**:

- Test loop timing at various BPMs (60, 120, 180)
- Measure timing drift over multiple loops
- Check Transport.seconds alignment

**Recommended Test**:

```typescript
// Log timing at loop boundaries
if (step === 0) {
  console.log('Loop restart:', {
    transportTime: Tone.Transport.seconds,
    nextStepTime: nextStepTimeRef.current,
    drift: nextStepTimeRef.current - Tone.Transport.seconds,
  })
}
```

### 3. Drum Note Length Variation

**Current**: All drums use '16n' duration **Opportunity**: Allow per-drum-type
note lengths

```typescript
const drumDurations = {
  kick: '8n', // Longer for sub-bass
  snare: '16n', // Standard
  hihat: '32n', // Shorter for tightness
  openhat: '4n', // Much longer for cymbal decay
}
```

**Impact**: More realistic drum sounds matching hardware behavior

### 4. BPM-Dependent Timing Tests

**Recommendation**: Add timing validation tests

```typescript
// Test timing accuracy at different tempos
;[60, 90, 120, 150, 180].forEach(bpm => {
  // Measure actual vs expected step timing
  // Calculate drift over 16-step loop
  // Verify synchronization between drums and melody
})
```

## ModularDrumKit Analysis

**Status**: Placeholder implementation **Location**:
`src/audio/instruments/ModularDrumKit.ts`

**Current State**:

- Uses basic Tone.Synth (not specialized drum synthesis)
- Simple oscillator types (sine, triangle, square)
- Fixed envelopes
- Not used in SequencerContext

**Observation**: SequencerContext uses DrumSynthesizer directly, not
ModularDrumKit

**Recommendation**: Either:

1. **Deprecate** ModularDrumKit if unused
2. **Integrate** ModularDrumKit with BaseInstrument architecture
3. **Enhance** to match DrumSynthesizer quality

## Timing Metrics & Performance

### Current Monitoring

```typescript
timingAnalysis = {
  averageLatency: number, // Mean timing deviation
  jitter: number, // Timing variance
  missedEvents: number, // Scheduling failures
  totalEvents: number, // Total scheduled
}
```

**Good**: Comprehensive timing metrics tracked **Opportunity**: Expose metrics
in UI for debugging/monitoring

### Performance Characteristics

- **Scheduler Overhead**: 25ms intervals (minimal CPU impact)
- **Lookahead Window**: 100ms (sufficient for smooth playback)
- **Event Cleanup**: Old events removed after 1 second
- **Memory Usage**: Bounded by lookahead window

## Grid Synchronization

### Current Implementation

**Drums**: Triggered via pattern array (SequencerContext:320-330) **Melody**:
Triggered via grid array (SequencerContext:303-312)

**Synchronization**:

- Both use same `scheduleStep()` function
- Both use same `transportTime` calculation
- Both scheduled within same lookahead window

**Conclusion**: Drums and melody are inherently synchronized via shared timing
system

### Step Alignment

```
Step 0:  Drum[0] + Grid[*][0] â†’ both scheduled at same transportTime
Step 1:  Drum[1] + Grid[*][1] â†’ both scheduled at same transportTime + stepLength
...
```

**No drift possible** - drums and melody share exact timing references

## Findings & Recommendations

### Critical Issues

**None Found** âœ…

### Testing Recommendations

1. **BPM Sweep Test**

## Conclusion

that sync issues are fixed is accurate - the current implementation uses
professional-grade timing techniques with lookahead scheduling and proper
Transport integration.

**No blocking issues found**. The system is ready for the next phase: improving
drum sound quality and adding musical expressiveness (velocity, longer patterns,
better presets).

### Next Steps
